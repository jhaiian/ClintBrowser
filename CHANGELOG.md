# Changelog

All notable changes to Clint Browser are documented here.

---

#v1.0.2-r3

- Fixed the bug related to “Open in apps” by re-adding the QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission.

---

# v1.0.2-r2

# v1.0.2

## 🎨 Look and Feel Updates

### Theme

- **Default** – Deep purple signature Clint style
- **Dark** – Dark background with white accents
- **Light** – Clean white background with dark accents

---

## 🎨 Accent Color

Select an accent color that changes backgrounds and UI accents in **Dark** and **Light** modes.  
In the **Default** theme, only accent elements (icons, dialogs, etc.) are tinted.

- **Default** – Standard theme colors

## 🌗 Surface Intensity

Controls how strong background and surface colors appear. Three modes are available:

- **Soft Tint** – Subtle background with a gentle tint
- **Strong Tint** – Deep dark surfaces with higher contrast
- **Pure Mode** – Pure black or pure white surfaces for maximum contrast

> ℹ️ **Availability**  
> - **Purple, Blue, Yellow, Red, Green, Orange**: All three modes.  
> - **Default Accent**: Only Soft Tint and Pure Mode.
> - **Material You**: Strong Tint is not available (system limitation).  
> - **Default theme**: Surface Intensity is not applied (preserves original design).


🔢 **Estimated ~52 possible theme combinations**

# 🚀 v1.0.2-beta-1

I added an App Theme setting in the **Look and Feel** fragment. From there, you can select a theme:

## 🎨 Themes

- 🟣 **Default** – Deep purple, signature Clint style  
- 🌙 **Dark** – Dark background with white accents  
- ⚪ **Light** – Clean white background with dark accents  

## ⚙️ Changes

- 🧭 The App Theme option has also been added to the second page of the Setup Wizard, next to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy agreements.  

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

- Fixed all bugs and issues in notification downloads.  
- Fixed `Builder.yml` not recognizing the new format of `CHANGELOG.md`.  
- Fixed the issue where the update changelog reader was cutting off content.  
- Fixed the beta enrollment not checking for stable releases.  

## 📁 Project Structure

The `MainActivity.kt` file has now been split into multiple components to improve maintainability and reduce its size (it was previously 1092 lines, which made it hard to manage).

- **MainActivity.kt (241 lines)**  
  Handles fields, lifecycle, preferences listener, and back key handling.

- **MainTabDelegate.kt (139 lines)**  
  Manages tab opening, closing, saving, restoring, and switching.

- **MainWebViewDelegate.kt (144 lines)**  
  Responsible for WebView creation, settings configuration, dark mode, user agent, desktop mode, and search engine URLs.

- **MainScrollDelegate.kt (131 lines)**  
  Handles bar animations, scroll tracking, and swipe refresh behavior.

- **MainUiDelegate.kt (264 lines)**  
  Manages the address bar, navigation buttons, popup menu, and overall UI updates.

- **MainFullscreenDelegate.kt (78 lines)**  
  Handles entering and exiting fullscreen mode.

- **MainFileChooserDelegate.kt (101 lines)**  
  Manages file selection and camera chooser functionality.

This change was made because `MainActivity.kt` had grown to 1092 lines, making it difficult to maintain and manage.
